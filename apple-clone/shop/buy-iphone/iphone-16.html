You can activate your iPhone outside the country if your carrier supports eSIM. Learn more about using eSIM while traveling (Opens in a new window).

An iPhone purchased from apple.com (Opens in a new window)  is unlocked. Once your new iPhone is activated, it remains unlocked, which means you can use it with any network that provides service for iPhone. However, if you buy an iPhone with an AT&T Installment Plan, your iPhone will be locked to AT&T and will only work on the AT&T network for the term of your Installment Plan agreement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When I buy from apple.com, does my iPhone come ready to use?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Carrier-connected iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 17, iPhone Air, and iPhone 17 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card.  If you completed the steps to authorize activation with AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon when you purchased your new iPhone online, it will arrive ready to use. Just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up and activate with the carrier. To activate with eSIM, you will need Wi-Fi for setup.  If you choose “Connect to a carrier later” when you buy your iPhone, you can activate your service when you receive your device. If you’re asked to transfer your SIM, follow the onscreen instructions to transfer service from your previous iPhone.
